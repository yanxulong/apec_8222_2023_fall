If this is not possible, please contact the instructors within the first week of class and we can discuss alternatives.  It is possible to use a PC, Mac or Linux for this course, though all examples will be given on a PC.  Becoming skilled in Big Data is partly about mastering the tools and it will be your responsibility to come to class with your computer setup in a way for you to succeed. We will discuss any setup steps necessary in the lecture before it is to be used."

Why an extra language?\n\nAlthough econometrics is still heavily centered on R, the Machine Learning community is dominantly focused on Python\n\nMostly because all of the key machine learning tools were developed in python: Scikit-Learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, FastAI, etc.\n\nPython is quickly gaining in usage relative to R, even within econometrics\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1: Monthly active users on Github Source: https://towardsdatascience.com/data-science-101-is-python-better-than-r-b8f258f57b0f\n\n\n\n\nGeneral purpose programming language\n\nPython is a General-Purpose programming language beyond just statistics, meaning you could:\n\nWrite your own web server, create a desktop application, make a computer game to test consumer decision making, automate your coffee pot, email your partner automatically when you are stuck at work late making slides for the lecture the next day but have lost track of time, deal with hundreds of thousands of files automatically, launch zoom with an AI-imposter of yourself listening attentively…\n\nQuick example from economics that illustrates this: Agent-Based Simulation\nBut perhaps most importantly, “Why not both?”\n\nYou can call R in Python and Python in R, leveraging the benefits of each.\nOur aim in this class is not to make you an expert in Python, but instead make it so you do not “get stuck” when a challenging problem that needs Python arises.\n\n\n\nPython is very easy compared to other languages\n\nPython or RJavaC++ASSEMBLER X86(DOS, MASM)Hexadecimal representationsBinary representations\n\n\n\n\nCode\nprint(\"Hello world!\")\n\n\nHello world!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.2: Java HelloWorld\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.3: C++ HelloWorld\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.4: DOS HelloWorld\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.5: Hexadecimal HelloWorld\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.6: Binary HelloWorld\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA note on econometrics and causal inference\n\nBefore we dive into ML, where does econometrics fit into this landscape?\n\nWe are good at causal inference.\nFrom Varian 2014: “Instrumental variables, regression discontinuity, difference-in-differences, various forms of natural and designed experiments (Angrist and Krueger 2001).”\n\nMachine Learning is only beginning to explore causality."

This means that if you don’t tell numpy to make a copy of something, any new variable will point to the old array. More specifically, this only creates a new pointer to the same block of memory on your computer that holds the array. If we change c_view, c will also be changed. So in the below, c_view only points to the old data in c. This is called a “view” of the array.\n\n\nCode\nc_view = array\n\n\nThis also means that if you modify array, you will be modifying what you have in c_view.\nIf you really need a copy in memory, you can use the numpy method copy():\n\n\nCode\nd = array.copy()\n\n\nThis gives us a NEW array in a new block of memory, so changing array will not change d,"

On my computer they are saved in the following locations.\nD:\\My Drive\\Files\\Teaching\\APEC 8222\\Data\\maize_HarvestedAreaHectares.tif\nD:\\My Drive\\Files\\Teaching\\APEC 8222\\Data\\maize_YieldPerHectare.tif\nUse the os.path.join() approach from earlier to correcly make relative paths (NOT ABSOLUTE PATHS LIKE I PASTED ABOVE) pointing to the two files.\nOpen them up as raster using Gdal.\nMultiply the HarvestedAreaHectars by YieldPerHectare. This will give you the total production on the grid-cell.\nUse numpy to sum up the total production of Maize globally and report that to the class."

    "section": "9.1 Question 1",
    "text": "9.1 Question 1\nThis question tests some basic python comprehension.\nThroughout, use comments to explain steps you are doing. No need to go overboard but it is always important in coding to be as descriptive as possible.\nMost things in this can be solved using methods shown in lecture. However, some cases will require you to search the internet for answers. This is intended because efficiently searching documentation or Stackoverflow is a requirement of modern programing.\nSubsequent questions will be specific to big data, statistics and economics, but for now we are just checking that you’re okay with the basics of Python.\nPart A: Write a python function that calculates the sum of all squared numbers from 1 to x. Illustrate that it works for x = 20.\nHINT, ** is the exponent operator in python. HINT syntax for a python function is:\ndef function_name(variable_name): outcome = variable_name + 1 return outcome\n\n\nCode\n# 1A Answer\n\n\nThe python library named “os” is a built-in library for dealing with any file on your operating system. Often, research tasks involve LOTS of files and you need to iterate over them. To show you know how to do this, use the os.listdir function to answer the following questions. Note that you need to write “import os” to import the library into your code before you can use it:\nPart B: Print out a list of all the files in the class repository (which you have gotten from GitHub). I don’t care how many are actually there (in case you’ve added some yourself) but show me how.\n\n\nCode\n#1B Answer\n\n\nPart C: Using a FOR loop, iterate over the list from above. Using the function len(), count how many letters there are in the filenames. HINT just like in real life, you may need to google the len() function and see how it work on e.g. strings.\n\n\nCode\n# 1C Answer\n\n\nPart D: Write a Python program which iterates over the integers from 1 to 50. For multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”. Hint: look up how to use the modulo operator (which is written as % in python) which would let you test when the remainder of a devision is exactly 0.\nSide-note, this is a hilariously over-used question that most software engineers get askedon their first interview for a job.\n\n\nCode\n# 1D Answer"

Using the gdal package and the gdal.Open() function, open up the land-use, land-cover map for Rwanda in 2000.\nIn this file, there is only 1 band in this file, so you can also access it with the GetRasterBand(1) function. Without reading the whole array, show how you can determine how many total grid-cells there are in this country.\n\n\nCode\n# 2A Answer\n\n\nPart b.) Using the results of part a, read the whole array into memory as a numpy array (the default option when using the ReadAsArray() funciton, and plot it using the matplotlib imshow command. Add a nice title to the plot describing what it is.\n\n\nCode\n#2B Answer\n\n\nPart c.) Using the legend you find at https://maps.elie.ucl.ac.be/CCI/viewer/download/ESACCI-LC-QuickUserGuide-LC-Maps_v2-0-7.pdf reclassify the LULC into a simplified map where 1 = cropland (including any mosaic types that are partially cropland) and 0 = anything else. Plot this using imshow.\n\n\nCode\n# 2C Answer\n\n\nPart d.) Repeat the process for the 2010 LULC map. Using this array with the one from part c, create a new array that records where there was cropland expansion (i.e., there is cropland in 2010 but not in 2000) and where there was cropland abandonment (cropland in 2000 but not in 2010). Save this classification in a single new array. Plot this last array. Optionally, add a legend indicating which values in the array denote expansion and abandonment using some variant of ax.legend()\n\n\nCode\n# 2D Answer\n\n\nPart e.) Overall, did Rwanada see net expansion or contraction of cropland over this period? Looking at the spatial results, do you see any patterns of where this happens? Is it in the north/south, near cities, replacing forests etc.?\n\n\nCode\n#2E Answer"

To do this, you will need to access the right parts of the data array and slice out the right column.\nHINT: You will need to read the DESCR to understand which column the BMI is stored in.\nHINT 2: To create a new variable with just the desired column of the array, you can use Array slicing notation like a = data_array[:, n] where the : means you want ALL rows, and the n means you want just column n.\nHINT 3: You may want to use data_array.sum(), data_array.mean(), and the ** exponent operator.\n\n\nCode\nbmi = data_array[:, 2]\n\nbmi_squared = bmi ** 2\n\nprint('Sum: ', bmi.mean())\nprint('Mean: ', bmi.mean())\nprint('Sum of squared: ', bmi_squared.mean())\n\n\nSum:  -2.2455642172282577e-16\nMean:  -2.2455642172282577e-16\nSum of squared:  0.0022624434389140265\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# For conveinence, sklearn also just has an option to get the key parts for the regression ready to use.\ndiabetes_X, diabetes_y = datasets.load_diabetes(return_X_y=True)\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n# Look at diabetes_X and notice there are lots of independent variables.

The following line extracts just the second column from the array. The colon was necessary because we access arrays using the ROW, COLUMN notation, so we sliced out all ROWS (the colon indicates all) and the second COLUMN.\n\n\nCode\ndiabetes_X = diabetes_X[:, 2]\n# diabetes_X = np.array([diabetes_X])\n# diabetes_X = diabetes_X[:, np.newaxis, 2]\n# print('diabetes_X', diabetes_X)\nprint('diabetes_X', diabetes_X.shape)\n\n# diabetes_X = diabetes_X.reshape((:, 1))\ndiabetes_X = diabetes_X.reshape((diabetes_X.shape[0], 1))\n\n# print('diabetes_X', diabetes_X)\nprint('diabetes_X', diabetes_X.shape)\n\n\ndiabetes_X (442,)\ndiabetes_X (442, 1)\n\n\n\n11.1.1 Split into training and testing arrays (the manual way)\nNext we are going to do a very rudimentary split of the data into training and testing sets using array slice notation. The following lines assigns the last all but the last 20 lines to the TRAIN set and the remaining 20 to the test set.\n\n\nCode\ndiabetes_X_train = diabetes_X[:-20]\ndiabetes_X_test = diabetes_X[-20:]\ndiabetes_y_train = diabetes_y[:-20]\ndiabetes_y_test = diabetes_y[-20:]\n\n\nCreate an empty LinearRegression object.\nIn the lines below, we will follow a relatively standardized process for running a model:\n\nCreate the model object.\nFit the model.\nPredict with the model\n\nThe basic notation for sklearn below first creates a regression model object using the linear_model that we imported above. This model is “empty” in the sense that it has no coefficients identified. Just like othertimes we’ve encountered objects (like numpy array objects), this object has many functions (called methods) and attributes which can be accessed by the dot operator.\n\n\nCode\nregression_object = linear_model.LinearRegression()\nprint('regression_object', regression_object)\n\n\nregression_object LinearRegression()\n\n\n\nUse the fit method\nUse the fit method from our regression object. It takes two inputs, the independent variables (X) and dependent variables (y).\nBelow, we will ONLY use the training subset of the data we created above.\n\n\nCode\nregression_object.fit(diabetes_X_train, diabetes_y_train)\nprint(regression_object)\n\n\nLinearRegression()\n\n\n\n\nUse the fitted model to predict values\nNow the regression_object is “trained,” which means we can also call it’s predict() method which will take some other observations and (in the case of OLS), multiple the new observations against our trained coefficients to make a prediciton.\nThe predict method returned an array of numerical predictions, which we will look at.\n\n\nCode\ndiabetes_y_pred = regression_object.predict(diabetes_X_test)\nprint(diabetes_y_pred)\n\n\n[225.9732401  115.74763374 163.27610621 114.73638965 120.80385422\n 158.21988574 236.08568105 121.81509832  99.56772822 123.83758651\n 204.73711411  96.53399594 154.17490936 130.91629517  83.3878227\n 171.36605897 137.99500384 137.99500384 189.56845268  84.3990668 ]\n\n\n\n\nLook at the coefficients\nMore interesting might be to look at the coefficients. Once the model has been fit, it has a new attribute .coef_ which stores an array of coefficients. In this case it will only be an array of length 1 because we just have one input.\n\n\nCode\nprint('Coefficients: \\n', regression_object.coef_)\n\n\nCoefficients: \n [938.23786125]\n\n\nYou might be wondering why we are looking at the coefficients as a raw array rather than at a nicely formatted regression table. The reason is in cross-validation approaches, these coefficients might just be one step towards the final model performance check on unseen data.\n\n\nEvaluating the fit\nWe can use sklearn’s built in evaluation functions, such as for the mean squared error or other metrics.\n\n\nCode\nmse = mean_squared_error(diabetes_y_test, diabetes_y_pred)\nprint('Mean squared error on the TEST data:',  mse)\n\n\nMean squared error on the TEST data: 2548.07239872597\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n# Or perhaps we want the r2 for the second independent variable (which is the only one we used)\nr2_score_value = r2_score(diabetes_y_test, diabetes_y_pred)\nprint('r2 calculated on TEST data: ', r2_score_value)\n\n\nr2 calculated on TEST data:  0.47257544798227147\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Finally, to prove to ourselves that we know what we are doing, let's plot this.\nplt.scatter(diabetes_X_test, diabetes_y_test,  color='black')\nplt.plot(diabetes_X_test, diabetes_y_pred, color='blue', linewidth=3)\n\nplt.show()"

Below, we print just the first (index = 0) numeral of the 5620 they provide.\n\n\nCode\n\nprint('digits.images[0]\\n', digits.images[0])\n\n\ndigits.images[0]\n [[ 0.  0.  5. 13.  9.  1.  0.  0.]\n [ 0.  0. 13. 15. 10. 15.  5.  0.]\n [ 0.  3. 15.  2.  0. 11.  8.  0.]\n [ 0.  4. 12.  0.  0.  8.  8.  0.]\n [ 0.  5.  8.  0.  0.  9.  8.  0.]\n [ 0.  4. 11.  0.  1. 12.  7.  0.]\n [ 0.  2. 14.  5. 10. 12.  0.  0.]\n [ 0.  0.  6. 13. 10.  0.  0.  0.]]\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n# If you squint, maybe you can tel what image it is, but let's plot it to be sure.\nimport matplotlib\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\nplt.imshow(digits.images[0])\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice also in the dataset that there is a ‘targets’ attribute in the dataset. This is the correct numeral that we are trying to make the model predict.\n\n\nCode\nprint('target', digits.target)\n\n\ntarget [0 1 2 ... 8 9 8]\n\n\nOur task now is to train a model that inputs the digit images and predicts the digit numeral. For this, we’re going to use SVM, as discussed in lecture.\n\n\nImport SVM and create a new (unfitted) model with it.\nFor now, the parameters are going to be manually set (gamme) but we’ll address how to choose them later. Here, I want to illustrate the basic approach used in sklearn to Load, train, fit and predict the model\n\n\nCode\nfrom sklearn import svm\n\n# Create the model object\nclassifier = svm.SVC(gamma=0.001)\n\n\nAt this point, classifier is not yet “trained”, ie. not yet fit to the model. All ML algorithms in SKLEARN have a .fit() method, which we will use here, passing it the images and the targets.\nBefore we train it, we want to split the data into testing and training splits.\nClass question: Remind me WHY are we splitting it here? What is the bad thing that would happen if we just trained it on all of them?\nBefore we can even split the data, however, we need to reshape it to be in the way the regression model expects.\nIn particular, the SVM model needs a 1-dimensional, 64 element array. BUT, the input digits we saw were 2-dimensional, 8 by 8 arrays.\nThis actually leads to a somewhat mind-blown example of how computers “think” differently than we do. We clearly think about a numeral in 2 dimensional space, but here we see that the computer doesn’t are about the spatial relationship ship at all. It sees each individual pixel as it’s own “Feature” to use the classification parlance. You could even reshuffle the order of those 64 digits and as long as you kept it consistent across the data, it would result in identical predictions.\nLater on, we will talk about machine learning techniques that leverage rather than ignore this 2 dimensional, spatial nature of the data.\nFor now, let’s just look at the data again.

(have to enable it first)\n\n\n15 Agenda\n\nComment on our hilariously “effective” p-hacking routine from last lecture.\n\nWe’ll address how can we do this in a legitimate way.\n\nIntroduce regularization and shrinkage\n\nDiscuss why we should do it.\n\nLearn Ridge and LASSO ML algorithms\nApply them in Code\n\n\n\n16 Econometrics versus CV\n\nEconometrics: X, Y not split into testing and training.\n\nY_hat is generated from OLS operating on All Data.\n\nIn the linear_regression notebook, we used Sklearn to automatically solve for the best set of (two) coefficients.\n\nIn this, we took our first baby step to CV by splitting into Training and Testing.\nWe learned SVM applied to this training/testing paradigm.\n\nThis is still not “Real CV” because we used the Test Data in finding the best set of coefficients.\n\n\n\n\n17 Real CV\n\n\nTherefor, cross-validation creates a second split of the training data.\n\nIteratively solves on this second-split.\n\n\n\n\n\n18 But that process can be extrapolated up to better utilize our (possibly scarce) data\n\n\nKeeping track of splits and folds is hard\n\nWe’re going to use GridSearchCV to do it all for us.\n\n\n\n\n19 Reminder on the bias-variance tradeoff\n\nReminder: ML lingo uses the word “Variance” in a slightly different way than we’re used to:\n\nHere, variance measures the difference in performance between on the training vs testing data\n\nThis is almost unrelated to the more familiar (to us) use of variance to describe a distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n20 One way to reduce variance: Shrinkage\n\nShrinkage estimators offer lower variance by construction\n\nIt’s literally just lowering your beta values.\nThe more we shrink coefficient estimates, the lower their variance across samples.\n\nTo build intuition on this, start with the extreme case: shrink all slope estimates to zero, make constant predictions.\n\nPerformance would be constant!\n\n\n\n\n21 Quick example and implications for bias\n\n\n22 Starting with OLS\n\nWhen we have many observations, OLS does a good job\n\nWhy? Because with tons of observations, it is more likely the training data reflect other possible data.\n\nE.g., suppose we have measurements of weight and size of mice. Fits pretty well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n23 But what if we have fewer data?\n\nSuppose we only get to fit the data on a small subset (red)\n\nThe resulting estimate is not similar to the full data in green\n\n\n\n\n\n24 Variance on out-of-sample observations is huge\n\n\nOur predicted line will have minimum bias on the training data\n\nIt’s the “Best Linear Unbiased Estimate” (BLUE)\n\nBut, there is huge variance on green.\nMain idea of regularization:\n\nWhat if we shrink the COEFFICIENT value in the OLS regression\nThis will obviously introduce more bias\n\nBut, as we will see, this almost always reduces out-of-sample variance\n\nThis is also referred to as “shrinkage”\n\n\n\n\n25 \n\n\n\nWhy did we just do this?\nIn general (VERY VERY OFTEN) shrinking our coefficients will improve out-of-sample performance\n\nIt is so important that in big data and ML applications, almost everything is regularized in some way.\n\n\n\n\n26 Shrinkage estimators: general form\n\n\n27 Shrinkage estimators: Lagrangian form\n\n\n28 Ridge regression\n\n\n29 Ridge Regression intuition\n\n\n30 Solution to Ridge\n\n\n31 Note about coefficient scaling\n\n\n32 LASSO: Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator\n\n\n\n33 LASSO: Not just another penalty.\n\n\n34 LASSO and variable selection\n\nWhen solved, LASSO may result in estimates of exactly zero for some parameters.\n\nIn other words, LASSO shrinks parameter estimates, and shrinks some to zero\nThis results in automated variable selection .\n\nSwitch to VS Code, notebook lectures/03_Regulariation/01_ridge_and_lasso.ipynb\n\n\n\n35 So what did we just do?\n\n\n36 Solution: reduce bias by using OLS after\n\n“post-LASSO regression”\n\nUse LASSO to estimate the main model, letting it do variable selection\nEstimate the main model with selected variables from step 1. This time use OLS.\n\nSwitch back to our notebook where we will implement this.\n\n\n\n37 Appendix\n\n\n38 Elastic Net: LASSO with a ridge\n\n\n39 IV and LASSO\n\n\n40 Motivation\n\n\n41 Many possible instruments in big data contexts\n\n\n42 How many instruments?\n\nAsymptotic theory:\n\nIF all instruments are exogenous and relevant, then they contain useful information.\nFor the most efficient (low variance) estimator, we should use all available information. Question is just how to combine it.\n2SLS can help recover optimal combination of those instruments.\n\nBut, we often have finite samples\nAnd, having too many instruments can introduce bias!\n\nHence, we need some well-thought-out model selection approach.\n\n\n\n\n43 Correct for overfitting-bias with LASSO\n\nIf bias arises from overfitting the first stage, we could try to limit overfitting.\n\nBelloni, Chen, Chernozhukov, Hansen (2012 Econometrica): LASSO!\n\nRough idea:\n\nEstimate first stage via LASSO (with specific penalization scheme)\nUse instruments selected via LASSO in first stage estimated via OLS\nUse fitted values in second stage\n\n\n\n\n44 Many instruments, many controls\n\n\n45 IV and not LASSO\nThe world isn’t always sparse\n\n\n46 Other options for the first stage\n\n\n47 Deep IV: setup\n\n\n48 Deep IV: idea"

Define them here using numpy logspace:\n\n\nCode\nalphas = np.logspace(-3, -0.5, 30)\nalphas\n\n\narray([0.001     , 0.00121957, 0.00148735, 0.00181393, 0.00221222,\n       0.00269795, 0.00329034, 0.00401281, 0.0048939 , 0.00596846,\n       0.00727895, 0.0088772 , 0.01082637, 0.01320352, 0.01610262,\n       0.01963828, 0.02395027, 0.02920904, 0.03562248, 0.04344412,\n       0.05298317, 0.06461671, 0.07880463, 0.0961078 , 0.11721023,\n       0.14294613, 0.17433288, 0.21261123, 0.25929438, 0.31622777])\n\n\nWe are going to be passing this range of tuning parameters to a GridSearch function that will test which works best when cross-validation methods are applied. First though, we have to put the alphas into the form the GridSearchCV funciton Expects, which is a list of dictionaries.\n\n\nCode\ntuning_parameters = [{'alpha': alphas}]\n\n\nRecall that CV works by calculating the fit quality of different folds of the training data. Here we will just use 5 folds. GridSearchCV will automatically implement the folding and testing logic.\n\n\nCode\nn_folds = 5\n\n\n\nCreate the lasso_cv object from the lasso object\nFinally, we have all our objects ready to pass to the GridSearchVC function which will Give us back a classifier object. Notice that we’re reusing that model_lasso objectg we created above. The difference is that we will be systematically handing different parameters from the tuning_parameters list into the model_lasso object.\n\n\nCode\nmodel_lasso_cv = GridSearchCV(model_lasso, tuning_parameters, cv=n_folds, refit=False)\n\n\n\n\nFit the lasso_cv object\nWhen we call the model_lasso_cv.fit() method, we will iteratively be calling the Lasso.fit() with different permutations of tuned parameters and then will return the classifier with the best CV fit.\n\n\nCode\nmodel_lasso_cv.fit(X, y)\n\n\nGridSearchCV(cv=5,\n             estimator=Lasso(alpha=0.8912509381337456, max_iter=10000,\n                             random_state=0),\n             param_grid=[{'alpha': array([0.001     , 0.00121957, 0.00148735, 0.00181393, 0.00221222,\n       0.00269795, 0.00329034, 0.00401281, 0.0048939 , 0.00596846,\n       0.00727895, 0.0088772 , 0.01082637, 0.01320352, 0.01610262,\n       0.01963828, 0.02395027, 0.02920904, 0.03562248, 0.04344412,\n       0.05298317, 0.06461671, 0.07880463, 0.0961078 , 0.11721023,\n       0.14294613, 0.17433288, 0.21261123, 0.25929438, 0.31622777])}],\n             refit=False)In a Jupyter environment, please rerun this cell to show the HTML representation or trust the notebook.

Calculate where the slope downwards is the steepest.\n\nTraverse part of the way down that slope, then recalculate derivatives.\nIteratively do this until you find the bottom.\n\n\n\n\n\n27 Simplified example of a neural net\n\n\n\nOnce trained, the neural net basically “combines squiggles” by adding up the fitted curves\n\n\n28 More complexity can be added to improve predictions\n\n\n\n29 Code Example: Analyzing imagery features\nBased on 500+ images of potentially malignant tumors, extracted variables such as radius, concavity, spacing, etc.\nCompared this to a medical test that identified if the tumor was in fact malignant.\nCODE TIME: Switch to VS Code.\n\n\n\n30 What did we just do?\n\nThe image below is the coefficients of the neurons in our network for different variables (vertical) and network layers (horizontal)\n\n\n\n31 Neural networks: challenges\n\nThrowing a bunch of nodes in layers won’t necessarily work well:\n\nIf you have lots of layers, it will take a long time to train\nSimply adding more nodes doesn’t always increase predictive accuracy\n\nUse problem knowledge to intelligently construct structure of network\n\nWhat about problems that require very large data?\n\nMaybe we want to impose the same weights in different parts e.g. “Convolutional Neural Networks”\n\n\n\n\n\n32 Convolutional Neural Nets\n\n\n33 In our SVM, we were “throwing away” the spatial information by flattening it.\n\nWhat if we try to keep that spatial information? Neural Nets apply can do this!\nHowever, traditional Neural Nets like we’ve just discussed in Code may break down under the huge information of images.\n\n\n34 Image analysis and CNNs.\nImagine an input image, where we’re trying to classify the image (rather than a pixel).\nSay we have 3 bands for that image, and the image is 100x100 pixels. That’s 30,000 inputs.\nSuppose we have one hidden layer with 10 neurons.\nIf we use a fully connected network (like in the code we just made), we would have 300,000 weights and 10 offsets to learn for that hidden layer. Too many.\n\n\n\n35 What are convolutions?\n\n\nhttps://miro.medium.com/max/2400/1*ciDgQEjViWLnCbmX-EeSrA.gif\n\n\n36 Layer types in CNNs\n\nConvolution layer:\n\nConstruct one or more “filters” that get passed over the pixel\nEach filter has a window of say 5x5 pixels. It moves with some “stride” length over the image.\nNeed to chose activation function (sign, linear, logistic)\n\n\n\n\n37 Fitting convolutions into neural nets\nNow perceptrons have convolution kernels as their definition\nSame back-propagation gradient descent method works to solve this\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n38 Layer types in CNNs\n\nThe convolutions can also be added to the rest of a fully-connected Neural Net\n\n\n39 Research advance I’m currently working on: Creating “reduced-form” spatial regression that can work on billion+ observations.\n\nGridded data preserve spatial structure\n\nNearby cells are highly correlated\nThe actual pattern may be a good predictor\n\nCan use 2-dimensional convolutions to express this structure\n\nE.g., identify what is the relationship between two variables as their distance increases via a flexible parametric form\n\n\nB.  Expression in 2- and 3-dimensions\nA.  Example 1-dimensional adjacency relationships\n\nThis is one of the parametric relationships we solve for\n\n\n\n40 Gaussian kernel\nSize = 21, Sigma 4\nApply this definition of spatial effect to each of the different land-use classes.\n\n\n\n41 Preliminary results\n\nGreatly outperforms the look-up table approach (IPCC method)\nEdge effects definitely exist\n\nBut still working to identify exact structure\n\n\n\n\n42 Appendix\nAdditional slides on own research\n\n\n\n43 Spatial results\n\nIncreases precision over linear model\nCan test specific edge-type hypotheses\n\nNote that marginal impact analysis of edge type is tricky\nNote also these use the LassoLarsCV method\n\nPreliminary conclusions:\n\nIntensive crops (class 10) have negative impact on carbon.\nNon-fragmented forests (class 50) has positive impact.\nCities (190) have negative impact.\n\n\n\n\n44 Linear model\n\n\n\n45 Spatial model"

For example, Python has   plotnine   which has the same syntax to R’s   ggplot2  . There’s also   plydata  , which has the same syntax as R’s   dplyr   package. In Python,   matplotlib   and   pandas   are more popular packages for plotting and data analysis, respectively, but those R-style packages are absolutely there if you prefer them.

    "text": "19.1 Introduction\nIn this chapter we will classify data from the Sentinel-2 satellite using a supervised classification approach which incorporates the training data represented as a vector (shapefile). Specifically, we will be using Naive Bayes. Naive Bayes predicts the probabilities that a data point belongs to a particular class and the class with the highest probability is considered as the most likely class. The way they get these probabilities is by using Bayes’ Theorem, which describes the probability of a feature, based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to that feature. Naive Bayes is quite fast when compared to some other machine learning approaches (e.g., SVM can be quite computationally intensive). This isn’t to say that it is the best per se; rather it is a great first step into the world of machine learning for classification and regression."

    "text": "19.2 Preparing the dataset\n\nOpening the images\nOur first step is to import the relevant packages. Of note are a couple new ones, namely rasterio and shapely. These are excellent libraries that simplify working with rasters and vectors (respectively). They wrap around GDAL so you don’t have to do it the hard way. They also provide some very useful helper functions, like mask and mapping, which we explicitly import below.\n\n\nCode\nimport rasterio\nfrom rasterio.mask import mask\nimport geopandas as gpd\nimport numpy as np\nfrom shapely.geometry import mapping\n\n\nNow we need to collect all the Sentinal-2 bands because they come as individual images one per band. Ultimately, we’re going to rewrite them into a multi-band (8 bands) geotiff for later use in regression.\n\n\nCode\nimport os # we need os to do some basic file operations\n\ndata_dir = \"../data/lulc_classification_example/\"\n\nsentinal_fp = os.path.join(data_dir, \"sentinel-2/\")\n\n# If this isn't working it's probably because you have the file saved somewhere else than where sentinal_fp points. \n# Examine the absolute path to investigate.\n\n\na = os.path.abspath(sentinal_fp)\n# find every file in the sentinal_fp directory\nsentinal_band_paths = [os.path.join(sentinal_fp, f) for f in os.listdir(sentinal_fp) if os.path.isfile(os.path.join(sentinal_fp, f))]\nsentinal_band_paths.sort()\nsentinal_band_paths\n\n\n['../data/lulc_classification_example/sentinel-2/2018-10-13, Sentinel-2B L1C, B01.tiff',\n '../data/lulc_classification_example/sentinel-2/2018-10-13, Sentinel-2B L1C, B02.tiff',\n '../data/lulc_classification_example/sentinel-2/2018-10-13, Sentinel-2B L1C, B03.tiff',\n '../data/lulc_classification_example/sentinel-2/2018-10-13, Sentinel-2B L1C, B04.tiff',\n '../data/lulc_classification_example/sentinel-2/2018-10-13, Sentinel-2B L1C, B05.tiff',\n '../data/lulc_classification_example/sentinel-2/2018-10-13, Sentinel-2B L1C, B06.tiff',\n '../data/lulc_classification_example/sentinel-2/2018-10-13, Sentinel-2B L1C, B07.tiff',\n '../data/lulc_classification_example/sentinel-2/2018-10-13, Sentinel-2B L1C, B08.tiff']\n\n\nBelow we will create a rasterio dataset object containing all bands in order to use the mask() function and extract pixel values using geospatial polygons.\nWe’ll do this by creating a new raster dataset and saving it for future uses.\n\n\nCode\n# create a products directory within the data dir which won't be uploaded to Github\nworkspace_dir = '../../textbook_workspace'\nimg_dir = os.path.join(workspace_dir, 'generated_lulc')\n\n# check to see if the dir it exists, if not, create it\nif not os.path.exists(img_dir):\n    os.makedirs(img_dir)\n\n# filepath for image we're writing out\nimg_fp = os.path.join(img_dir, 'sentinel_bands.tif')\n\n# Read metadata of first file and assume all other bands are the same\nwith rasterio.open(sentinal_band_paths[0]) as src0:\n    meta = src0.meta\n\n# Update metadata to reflect the number of layers\nmeta.update(count = len(sentinal_band_paths))\n\n# Read each layer and write it to stack\nwith rasterio.open(img_fp, 'w', **meta) as dst:\n    for id, layer in enumerate(sentinal_band_paths, start=1):\n        with rasterio.open(layer) as src1:\n            dst.write_band(id, src1.read(1))\n\n\nOkay we’ve successfully written it out now let’s open it back up and make sure it meets our expectations:\n\n\nCode\nfull_dataset = rasterio.open(img_fp)\nimg_rows, img_cols = full_dataset.shape\nimg_bands = full_dataset.count\nprint(full_dataset.shape) # dimensions\nprint(full_dataset.count) # bands\n\n\n(2201, 2629)\n8"

We also use numpy slice notation to clip out a smaller part of the array.\nHOWEVER, the image won’t look right on its own. You can kind of tell there is color, but it doesn’t look like it should. That’s because we’re reading in the wrong bands (our eyes are expecting Red, Green and Blue).\nAs a class race, try out different combinations of bands. When you think you’ve got it, raise your hand. When someone gets it, or after 2 minutes, whoever has the best image wins!

ML algorithms will iteratively try different models/coefficients on this second spit, using whichever performs best on the training-test data.\nBut we can do MORE than that!\n\n\n\nSplitting into MANY Splits and Folds\n\n\nFirst slice your data into n-folds (here \\(n\\) is 5)\nCreate Split \\(n\\) by defining the test-data as fold 𝑛 and the training data as the other Folds.\nTest your model on all different splits.\n\nReport the mean-squared error (MSE) over all the splits\n\nWhy are we doing this?\n\nIteratively find the best model.\n\n\n\n\nFinal model performance analysis\n\n\nOnce the best set of parameters are found, the model is compared against the test data from the first split.\nFinal performance assessment then is done with calculating the MSE of the model prediction of Test_X for Test_Y\nThis method is SUPER FLEXIBLE\n\nIt could compare totally dissimilar models in a rigorous way.\nWill helps us choose “tuning-” or “hyper-parameters”"
